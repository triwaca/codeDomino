Code Domino is a tangible programming language based on LOGO, build to be accessible to children and beginners in programming. The language is build to be represented by physical domino pieces, where every command (or set of commands) is represented by a piece, who can be moved, removed, interchanged between users and copied. To run the command, users must have a robot who can read pieces phisically, or receive it through another device (Eg. mobile phone reads using camera and send to robot using bluetooth or Wi-Fi). The robot must be able to perform LOGO commands.
